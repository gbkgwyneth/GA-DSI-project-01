### Overview

A look at SAT and ACT scores around the United States.

For our first project, we're going to take a look at SAT and ACT scores around the United States. Suppose that the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - seeks to improve the participation rate of its exams. Your presentation should be geared toward non-technical executives with the College Board and you will use, at minimum, the provided data to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rates of these exams.
